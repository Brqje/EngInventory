# EngInventory
EngInventory - Baroque 2019 edit

One-bag with item type auto-sort. I've modded it to use sensible categorization/auto sorting.

Modifications:

- Updated TOC for 1.12
- Extended bag slot support from 109 slots to 128 slots (16-slot main bag & 4x 28-slot bag)
- Modified OpenAllBags hook to allow Blizzard "Open All Bags" keybind to actually toggle, instead of just open bags (similar to default UI behaviour)
- Updated categorization (updated search algorithms and added over 200 items)

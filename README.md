EngInventory - 2019 Baroque edit

One-bag with item type auto-sort. I've modded it to use sensible categorization/auto sorting for both leveling and end-game Vanilla 1.12. It's modified for all the requirements of a serious Vanilla end-game raider in 2019, presenting inventory contents in a streamlined way.

Modifications:

- Updated TOC for 1.12
- Extended bag slot support from 109 slots to 128 slots (16-slot main bag & 4x 28-slot bag)
- Modified OpenAllBags hook to allow Blizzard "Open All Bags" keybind to actually toggle,
  instead of just open bags (similar to default UI behaviour)
- Modified default settings: scale from 0.64 to 1 and columns from 9 to 10
- Modified categorization groups
- Modified categorization string search patterns
- Added over 200 items to specifically categorize (default override)

The general idea is that similar consumables should be grouped. The same applies to tokens and class items. Also, buffs which are clicked pre-combat (food buffs, elixirs, weapon buffs), are placed to the left, for easy ergonomic access. Potions and runes should always be keybound to action bars, so they're placed to the right. Item sorting is split to 15 groups, with most having subgroups as well:

15: explosives / 14: projectiles, soul shards / 13: gray items, empty bag slots

12: boe items, class books, recipes, general reagents, tradegoods / 11: tradeskill, tradeskill created / 10: other soulbound

9: rogue poisons, weapon buffs / 8: other keys, quest items, misc items, tokens / 7: gear which has been equipped

6: flasks, zanza buffs, blasted land buffs, elixirs / 5: bandages, juju's, other consumables / 4: potions, runes

3: food (including food buffs), drinks / 2: class reagents / 1: hearthstone, passive class items, trade tools, mounts, mini pets

Within a group, subgroups are alphabetically sorted.
Within a subgroup, items are also alphabetically sorted.

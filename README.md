EngInventory - 2019 Baroque edit

One-bag with item type auto-sort. I've modded it to use sensible categorization/auto sorting for both leveling and end-game Vanilla 1.12.

Modifications:

- Updated TOC for 1.12
- Extended bag slot support from 109 slots to 128 slots (16-slot main bag & 4x 28-slot bag)
- Modified OpenAllBags hook to allow Blizzard "Open All Bags" keybind to actually toggle, instead of just open bags (similar to default UI behaviour)
- Modified default settings: scale from 0.64 to 1 and columns from 9 to 10
- Modified categorization groups
- Modified categorization string search patterns
- Added over 200 items to specifically categorize (default override)

**Difference examples**, the general idea is that consumables which share buff slots or cooldowns, should be grouped. The same applies to tokens.
